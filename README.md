### Hi 👋


- 👨‍🎓 I’m a third year software engineering student at OsloMet
  * OsloMet has thought me the basics of: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, Java, SQL, Python, Flask, Bash, Docker, Postman, Git and agile software development.
  * The coming year we we will learn about C#, .NET, Angular, cyber security and more.

- 🌱 In my spare time and at work I’m currently learning more JavaScript with [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) course and I just started looking into React with [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) guide.
