### Hi 👋


- 👨‍🎓 I’m a third year software engineering student at OsloMet
  * OsloMet has thought me the basics of: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6 + JQuery, Java, MySQL, Python + Flask, Bash, Docker, Postman and Git.
  * The coming year we we will learn about .NET Core, C#, Angular, cyber security, real life IT-projects and more.

- 🌱 In my spare time and at work I’m currently learning more JavaScript with [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) Udemy course. Future projects will be to learn about React and the rest of the MERN stack.
